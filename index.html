           <br>
           Art education materials commonly make claims about red, yellow and blue as the primary colors and that they can mix all colors. These claims have long been criticized from the perspective of modern color science as no set of real colorants or lights can mix all possible colors.

        <div id="text" style="display:none;">Red is the color at the long wavelength end of the visible spectrum of light, next to orange and opposite violet. It has a dominant wavelength of approximately 625–740 nanometres.
        <br>
        Blue is one of the three primary colours of pigments in painting and traditional colour theory, as well as in the RGB colour model. It lies between violet and green on the spectrum of visible light. The eye perceives blue when observing light with a dominant wavelength between approximately 450 and 495 nanometres. 
        <br>
        Yellow is the color between orange and green on the spectrum of visible light. It is evoked by light with a dominant wavelength of roughly 570–590 nm.
